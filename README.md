## [Project 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCIJqtOqkC8&list=PLjYn2orKlXao0Md4v8fdI1jtU_qiZbOSM)
For this project, I build a very interactive dashboard using MS excel for my former employer, Chicken Baristo. I extracted sales data from their POS and went to work. The data was in bad shape, I cleaned it using the PowerQuery which linked with the main data source thus cleaning any new data I brought in. From this clean data, I created numerous PivotTables that linked to the main cleaned sheet. This allowed me to make PivotCharts that were automatically updated once new data came in. I later proceeded to create a very interactive dashboard that was used to identify a problem in the sales of grilled chicken, one of the products on the menu, this led to an investigation which helped the directors to realize that the change in marination 2 months prior was killing their top seller product. Many more wonderful discoveries were made from this dashboard. You can see me teaching how I made it step by step on my [YouTube tutorial on how to create a completely interactive excel dashboard.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCIJqtOqkC8&list=PLjYn2orKlXao0Md4v8fdI1jtU_qiZbOSM). The technology used here was **Advanced MS Excel**.

## [Project 2](https://github.com/NgangaNgaruiya001/Adding-PostgreSQL-as-your-database)
The client of this project was the AGED department of Egerton University. They had done some research and had gained a lot of data on their students, including names, email addresses, and phone numbers. They thus decided to database this information and I was contracted to do so. Instead of just storing it in a generic database I decided to develop this web app where they could view them, search them on multiple parameters and add new students with ease. The login system also allowed the lecturers in the department to have their profiles which they can use individually from anywhere in the world. The user interface was extremely easy to use and was designed for anyone who is or is not computer savvy. You can see me teaching how I made it step by step on my [YouTube tutorial on how to create a Django website](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RO3IjgcEBI&list=PLjYn2orKlXaqLw3U8RecBtz-FMckbwb1y). The technology used was **Python** and its web framework **Django**.

## [Project 3](https://github.com/NgangaNgaruiya001/sentiment_tool).
In this project, my main purpose was to create a simple application that can be used to analyze the sentiments of tweets on a specific search topic. I used the Twitter API to connect to the Twitter app then I proceeded to use a pre-trained NLP called TextBlob to analyze this data and I presented the results using a seaborn to display the number of positive tweets, negative tweets, and neutral tweets on a bar graph. The technology used was **Python** and the **Pandas** and **Seaborn** packages. You can see me teaching how I made it step by step on my [YouTube tutorial on how to create a Twitter sentiment analysis tool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Srqs-vbTSXg&t=229s&ab_channel=LearnwithNgangaNgaruiya).

## [Project 4](https://github.com/NgangaNgaruiya001/crimevsbhangEDA)
This study was done by Nganga Ngaruiya. It was undertaken to research whether there is a relationship and influence of bhang possession charges to the total crimes cases in Kenya.       
The information collected also shed some light on the counties with the highest crime rate and bhang possession charges per square area and population size.    
The packages used are
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Numpy
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn


I collected data from Wikipedia and the Kenya Police website crime statistics.    
I Cleaned them and merged them to form a singular data frame dropping all the unnecessary columns and rows.   
I then proceeded to make new relevant columns that help me calculate rates which I used to answer the research objectives, which were:
- Find out the county with the highest crime rates (per 10000 people and 10km2) and also for the crimes we are interested in, in this research
- The distribution of Bhang possession charges per 10000 people and 10km2
- Correlation between bhang and crime rates (per 10000 people and 10km2) and also for the crimes we are interested in, in this research
- Check the influence of bhang on crime rates

I used 2020 data since the 2019 data did not have the data on the drugs separated on the county level

I am currently working on the YouTube video of me teaching this and it will be out **really soon**.
